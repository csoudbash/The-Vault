# THE VAULT

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

Designed, Created, and Deployed a Password Vault/Manager. i took a heavy inspriation from LastPass, a well known and used Password Vault/Manager. The main focus of this Password Vault/Manager was to be able to store entire accounts information and be able to nicely organize them into customizable folders.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `prime_app`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
